## Aman Datla's First CS193 Homework

- I love how the class teaches you essential things you may have slowly forgotten over the course of learning various new materials
- It's great how the class serves as a reinforcment to new concepts as well
- It's magnificent how well taught the class is and how every topic is explained in a fashion that's easy to understand.
